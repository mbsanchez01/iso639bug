# Description

This repository was created as minimal required code to reproduce the import issue of the library `npm iso-639-1` on NestJS. We are using the library version 3.0.1

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev
```

## Code Structure

The [controller](src/app.controller.ts) class defined two endpoints, http://localhost:3000/buggy and http://localhost:3000/ok, on which we show the minimal code to reproduce the bug and how to work around it.

The controller class import two services

1. [AppServiceBuggy](src/app.service.buggy.ts) on which we import the library `Ã¬so-639-1` to reproduce the bug

```javascript
import { Injectable, Logger } from "@nestjs/common";
import ISO6391, { LanguageCode } from "iso-639-1";

@Injectable()
export class AppServiceBuggy {
  getLanguagesBuggy(): LanguageCode[] {
    return ISO6391.getAllCodes();
  }
}
```

2. [AppService](src/app.service.ok.ts) on which we work around the bug.

```javascript
import { Injectable, Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as ISO6391 from 'iso-639-1';
import { LanguageCode } from 'iso-639-1';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getLanguagesOK(): LanguageCode[] {
    return (ISO6391 as any).getAllCodes();
  }
}
```

## Reproducing the bug

To reproduce the bug you can execute the next command

```bash
#command
curl http://localhost:3000/buggy

#output
{"statusCode":500,"message":"Internal server error"}
```

In the app's console, you should see:
